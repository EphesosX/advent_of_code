My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). These aren't meant to be perfect solutions; I've mostly left them in the state that I finished in, after trying to write them as quickly as possible. Often they will only solve part 2, if I wrote over my code for part 1.

Each solution uses text files "test_input.txt" and "input.txt" for input. Usually I copy paste into "test_input.txt" from the AoC page, and then download "input.txt" to the folder. As AoC requests, I have not uploaded these input files.

For 2024 (and hopefully future years), I've added a utils module with some common functions like printing grids, stepping in a direction, etc., as well as a template for starting the day. Sometimes I make changes to the utils module partway through a day that break older days; I've tried to go back after finishing and update the old days to still work, but I can't guarantee I got them all. If a solution isn't working, it's probably best to checkout the commit that solution was first uploaded on.
